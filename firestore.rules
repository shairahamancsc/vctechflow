/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the ServiceFlow application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for Customers and Technicians,
 * restricting access to a user's own data. Service Requests and Notifications
 * are generally accessible, but writes are restricted.  ServiceLogs are secured
 * under their parent ServiceRequest.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /customers/{customerId}: Stores customer profile information.
 * - /technicians/{technicianId}: Stores technician profile information.
 * - /serviceRequests/{serviceRequestId}: Stores service request data.
 * - /serviceRequests/{serviceRequestId}/logs/{logId}: Stores service logs.
 * - /notifications/{notificationId}: Stores notifications for users.
 * - /parts/{partId}: Stores data about replacement parts.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Customers and Technicians can only access their own profile data.
 * - Listing of users (customers or technicians) is disallowed.
 * - Service Requests and Notifications are publicly readable.
 * - Service Logs are secured via their parent Service Request.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The rules leverage path-based ownership for Customers and Technicians, avoiding the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.
